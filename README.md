# Custom filter Component

This is reusable component. This widget can be used in any project where there is a need for dynamic filters requirent. As many as filters can be added dynamically by the user. I can be used in advanced search operations.

Note: If you face any path related issues then just place 'ped-grid-filter' under 'app/'.
